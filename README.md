**Context** :

- Neurons in the brain communicate information by generating sequences of 
  electrical pulses (binary events, called spikes). These spiking (binary)
   sequences from populations of neurons are known to carry information 
  about the current brain activity state of an animal. However, spiking 
  sequences of individual neurons, acting as a neural code, should reflect
   information processing in the brain as well. Understanding this code 
  and predicting the behavioral state or an action from the underlying 
  neuronal activity is one of the central problems of quantitative 
  neuroscience. Being able to use single neuron spiking data to infer 
  brain state can drastically reduce the number of experiments biological 
  scientists need to perform. At a more fundamental level, the challenge 
  will help quantify how single-cell neural code reflects the brain state.



##### Challenge goals :

- The challenge goal is to classify the brain activity state of an animal 
  based on spiking activity patterns of its individual neurons. For this 
  purpose, participants are given recordings of neural spike sequences 
  from the hippocampi of rats. Each spiking sequence in the dataset has a 
  corresponding activity state label (two brain states, labeled STATE1, or
   STATE2). This is, therefore, a binary classification problem, where 
  each data sample is a time series and participants have to predict which
   class a given time series sample belongs to.
